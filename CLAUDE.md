# CLAUDE.md

A static recompilation of the N64 *F-Zero X* (USA) with N64Recomp, N64ModernRuntime, RecompFrontend and RT64, from
the inspectredc/fzerox symbols. Almost all of it is written by AI agents, so this file is what the next one needs: the
rules, where things are, and the facts about the game the code can't say on its own.

## What lives where

This repo is the game: its recompilation, the patches over it, the desktop build and its web page.

- `syms/`: the symbols N64Recomp reads, generated (never edited by hand) by `tools/build_decomp.sh` then
  `tools/gen_syms.sh` (`tools/gen_syms.py` says how).
- `us.toml`: N64Recomp's configuration; `tools/recompile.sh` writes `RecompiledFuncs/` with it, and the audio
  microcode with `aspMain.us.toml`.
- `patches/` and `patches.toml`: MIPS C against `lib/fzerox`'s headers, recompiled into PatchesLib. Its `ui_funcs.h`,
  `patch_helpers.h` and `recompui_event_structs.h` are RecompFrontend's, which includes the first from the game's
  `patches/`.
- `src/`: RecompFrontend's main (`src/main/main.cpp`, with the GameEntry), the natives the patches call
  (`src/game/recomp_api.cpp`), the libultra functions the runtime lacks (`src/game/libultra.cpp`) and the settings.
- `lib/`: `fzerox` (the decomp, for the symbols and the patches' headers), upstream `rt64`, `N64ModernRuntime` and
  `RecompFrontend` at the commits N64Recomp-browser's web forks are built on, and `N64Recomp-browser` at a release tag.
  The web support every recomp's page shares is developed and documented there; `tools/build_n64recomp.sh` and
  `CMakeLists.txt` apply its `patches/` to the other three, and `CMakeLists.txt` then this game's own changes to them
  (`runtime-patches/`, its README lists them).
- `docs/web.md`: the web page: `tools/build_web.sh`, its prebuilt shader list (`src/rt64_shaders.txt`,
  `tools/shader_plan.json`, `tools/record_shaders.sh`) and its play plans (`tools/play_plan*.json`).
- `docs/architecture.md`: how the game and its recompilation fit together, the facts the code can't say on its
  own (How it fits together, below).
- Comments beside the code, for how and why: each file's header. Read the header of the file you change and update
  it in the same commit.

## Rules

- No ROMs, ROM-derived assets or extracted game data in git, CI or PRs (`tools/ci/check_repo.py` checks). Nothing from
  the decomp's `assets/` or its build is committed but `syms/`. The icon (`icons/icon.svg`, the launcher's thumbnail and
  the program's icon by `tools/icon.py`) is drawn for the project from plain shapes: no logo, character or picture from
  the game.
- The decomp is built only where the ROM is, never in CI.
- The desktop releases are built where the ROM is too, by `tools/release.sh` (its header says how), and published to
  GitHub Releases with their notes in `releases/`.
- The scope is the game as it plays, plus what a web page needs (RT64 interpolation to the display's rate, resolution
  Auto), plus modern enhancements: each an option with an Original value that plays as the console does, none
  changing how the game plays. USA only: the Expansion Kit is out of scope.
- Code from G-Diffuser or any other F-Zero X project may be read for what it changes, but nothing that isn't the
  decomp's is copied.
- Write for a stranger, in the present tense: nothing about a contributor's machine, servers, paths or accounts, and
  nothing about where anyone keeps ROMs.
- GPL-3.0, as the recompilations it follows.

## How it fits together

`docs/architecture.md` has the facts about the game the code can't say on its own: the code, the entry point, reads of
the ROM by the CPU, no 64DD, microcodes, jump tables, saves, input, testing without the speakers, interpolation,
widescreen and the game's own pacing. Read its part before changing the recompilation, a patch or a hook, and add a new
finding there, not here.
